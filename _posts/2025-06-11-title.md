when i was young were always interested on how things works. in one of those ocation i was wondering how a computer is builded
then i become couriouss about computers and other kind of machines as robots but someday start the 7th grade at school, for those who dont now i am from mexico
here we have to start at other school caled secondary school or midschool for 3 years and instead elementary its only for 6 years.
there was a course on computing that i choose to take and then i start to learn all about computers and basics from robotics.
once i reach 9th grade at school I started learmimg html and how a webpage works thats how i start getting into coding.
